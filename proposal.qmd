```{python}
#| label: load-pkgs
#| message: false
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```

## Dataset

```{python}
#| label: load-dataset
#| message: false
df = pd.read_csv("data/creditcard.csv")
df_shape = df.shape
df_preview = df.head()
```

The dataset used is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle, which contains r df_shape[0] rows and r df_shape[1] columns of anonymized transaction data from European cardholders in 2013.
I chose this dataset because it is extremely imbalanced with less than 0.2% fraudulent cases. This makes it an excellent candidate for anomaly detection techniques.


## Questions

1. Can unsupervised models like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor identify fraudulent transactions without seeing labels?
2. How well do basic methods like k-NN and z-scores work compared to more advanced models like Isolation Forest when trying to find unusual transactions?
