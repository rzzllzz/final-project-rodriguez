This project uses the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, containing transactions made by European cardholders over two days in 2013. The dataset includes 284,807 transactions, with only 492 labeled as fraudulent (Class = 1), making it highly imbalanced.

Although the dataset includes labeled anomalies, I am approaching this as an unsupervised anomaly detection task, simulating a real-world scenario where fraudulent examples are not labeled during model training. Labels are withheld during training and used only for model evaluation.

## Questions

1.  How well do unsupervised ensemble-based models detect fraudulent transactions when labels are withheld during training?
2.  How do distance-based and statistical approaches to outlier detection compare to ensemble-based methods in identifying rare but meaningful anomalies?

## Analysis plan

-   Data Preprocessing (August 6–7)

    -   Load and clean the dataset; scale relevant features.

-   Modeling: Unsupervised Learning (August 8–10)

    -   Implement anomaly detection methods.

-   Evaluation (August 11–13)

    -   Assess model performance.

-   Visualization (August 13–16)

    -   Create performance plots and visual summaries of detected anomalies.

-   Presentation Prep (August 17–19)

    -   Finalize presentation materials and write-up of results.
