This makes it an excellent candidate for anomaly detection techniques.\n\n\n## Questions\n\n1. Can unsupervised models like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor identify fraudulent transactions without seeing labels?\n2. \n\n## Analysis plan\n\n- Data Preprocessing\n    - August 6 to August 7\n- Modeling: Unsupervised learning\n    - August 8 to August 10\n- Evaluation\n    - August 11 to August 13\n- Visualization\n    - August 13 to August 16\n- Presentation prep \n    - August 17 to August 19\n\n",
